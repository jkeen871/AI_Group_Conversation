## 7. Setup and Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/jkeen871/ai-conversation-gui.git
   cd ai-conversation-gui
   ```

2. Install required packages:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Set up API keys in `keys.py`.

4. Configure Google API credentials for email functionality.

## 8. Running the Application
Run the application using:
```
python convo.py
```

## 9. Adding and Editing Personalities

### Using the GUI
1. **For AI Personalities:**
   - Click on the "Edit AI Personalities" button in the control panel.
   - In the new window, click "Add New Personality" to create a new AI personality.
   - Fill in the details: Name, System Message, AI Name (model), and Color.
   - Click "Save Changes" to add the new personality.

2. **For Helper Personalities:**
   - Click on the "Edit Helper Personalities" button in the control panel.
   - Follow a similar process as AI personalities to add or edit helper personalities.

3. **For AI Configurations:**
   - Click on the "Edit AI Configs" button to modify AI model settings.

### Editing Files Manually
You can also add or edit personalities by directly modifying the `personalities.py` file:

1. Open `personalities.py` in a text editor.
2. Locate the `AI_PERSONALITIES` or `HELPER_PERSONALITIES` dictionary.
3. Add a new entry or modify an existing one.

### Personality Setup Examples

1. **AI Personality Example:**
```python
"Dyann": {
    "name": "Dyann",
    "system_message": "You are Dyann, a conservative-leaning AI with expertise in interior design and ancient history...",
    "ai_name": "anthropic",
    "color": "blue",
    "character": "ùçÑ"
},
```

2. **Helper Personality Example:**
```python
"TopicGenerator": {
    "name": "TopicGenerator",
    "system_message": "You are the TopicGenerator. Your task is to generate a short, concise topic based on the conversation context provided...",
    "ai_name": "anthropic",
    "color": "cyan",
},
```

3. **AI Configuration Example:**
```python
"anthropic": {
    "model": "claude-3-opus-20240229",
    "generate_func": anthropic_generate,
},
```

When adding personalities manually, ensure that you follow the existing structure and include all necessary fields. After making changes, restart the application for them to take effect.

## 10. Extending the Application
To add new features or AI personalities:

1. Update `AI_PERSONALITIES` or `HELPER_PERSONALITIES` in `personalities.py`.
2. Add new AI model configurations in `ai_config.py` if necessary.
3. Implement new UI components in `convo_gui.py`.
4. Extend the `ConversationManager` class in `conversation_manager.py` for new conversation management features.
5. Update the various editing classes (`EditPersonalities`, `EditAIConfigs`, `EditHelperPersonalities`) to allow editing of new configurations through the GUI.

## 11. Error Handling and Logging
- Comprehensive error handling is implemented throughout the application.
- Detailed logging is set up in `convo.py` and used across all files.
- Logs are written to 'log/app.log' for debugging and troubleshooting.
- The GUI displays error messages to the user when appropriate.

## 12. Testing
- Implement unit tests for individual components (e.g., ConversationManager methods, AIConversationGUI methods).
- Create integration tests to ensure proper interaction between different modules.
- Perform end-to-end testing of the entire conversation flow through the GUI.
- Use PyQt's testing utilities for GUI-specific tests.

## 13. Performance Considerations
- The application uses asynchronous programming to handle concurrent operations efficiently.
- Consider implementing caching mechanisms for frequently accessed data or AI responses.
- Monitor and optimize AI model API usage to manage costs and improve response times.
- Use PyQt's built-in optimization techniques, such as lazy loading for UI components.

## 14. Security Considerations
- Ensure proper handling and storage of API keys and sensitive configuration data.
- Implement input validation and sanitization to prevent potential security vulnerabilities.
- Consider implementing user authentication if extending the application for multi-user scenarios.
- Use secure methods for storing and retrieving user preferences and conversation history.
